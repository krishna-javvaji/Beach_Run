 2D Game with Game Maker
Team Bahubali Creative Studios
Game Title: Gun N Win
Game Rating: Everyone(pending)
Genre: 2D platformer/ Platform Shooter
The goal of the game is to travel through all three portals,
avoiding/shooting skulls that come in our way. The skulls do shoot us which
spices up the game.
Initially, the menu is displayed with 3 options, start, controls, and exit.
By clicking on Start the game begins. Clicking on the Controls button
displays the basic controls of the game. The exit button is used for moving
out of the game.
The game is a single-player one, who can be controlled using arrow
keys. Once the player obtains the gun, he/she can shoot the skulls using
the E key.
Once the game is started, the player spawns in a place crawling with
skulls. He/She has to survive them and travel into the vast portals to be
safe. The place also has a gun that helps him/her in surviving. Once the
player collects the gun, then he/she can shoot the skulls using it. A player
can move into the next portal by just passing through it.
The player action includes moving using keyboard keys, shooting the
skulls using the E key, and traveling through portals.
The skulls do have the ability to shoot, and the player is granted three
lives. Once a player is hit by the skull or with the bullet fired by the skull,
he/she loses a life point. Once a player successfully shoots the skull he/she
is granted 10 score points.
Since portal 3 is too big the game is provided with a mini-map on the
left side of the game. The score and lives of the player are displayed in the
left corner of the screen.
If the player loses all his 3 lives then he is navigated to the lost
screen.
If the player successfully travels through all the 3 stages then a
winning screen is displayed with the number of points scored.
